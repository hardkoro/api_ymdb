# API YaMDB

## Description

API allows to retrieve data from YaMDB â€” a service where people can share reviews of different works of art, such as movies, books etc. The service is implemented on Django Rest API.

A JWT token is used for an authentication. It can be obtained after authorization via e-mail.

Reviews can be written for each of the posts, and comments can be written for each review. You can leave a rating as for reviews, as for comments. Search and filtering are available.

Endpoints are described in the docs: http://localhost/redoc/.
